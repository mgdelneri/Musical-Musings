# Musical Musings

## Description

Musical Musings is an application that allows people to exchange ideas and opinions about their favorite musical artists. This project uses Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars.js, Sequelize, a MySQL database, and Cloudinary. Cloudinary provides an API for image management.

The user can sign up and log in to the application, and their information will be safely secured and saved to the back-end for future use. 

## Process

Before doing any coding, we talked as a group to look over the assignment requirements and think about an application that would be useful as well as interesting to all group members. Because we shared a love of music, we thought it would be within the realm of this project to create a social-networking-style app that allows users to log in and post about music. They would also be able to comment on other people's posts. 

Once we had solidified an idea, we created the repo in GitHub that included the main branch as well as each member's individual branch. 

We then started organizing all of the folders and files that we knew we would need, using the MVC paradigm and referring back to past activities from class. 

To start coding each file, each group member took a section of the repo and started filling in standard code that we had seen in past activities. Once this was done, we tested the router, the app, and MySQL, making sure that we could at least connect to the server and see that that handlebars were showing up in the browser.
